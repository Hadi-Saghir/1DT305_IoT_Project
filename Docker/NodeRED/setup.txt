Step 1: Assuming you have Docker installed and running, open a web browser and visit http://localhost:1880 to access the Node-RED web interface.

Step 2: In the Node-RED interface, click on the menu icon located in the top-right corner, and select "Manage palette". This will open the Node-RED palette manager.

Step 3: In the palette manager, navigate to the "Install" tab.

Step 4: In the search bar, enter "influxdb" and press Enter. Search for the following nodes one by one: "node-red-contrib-influxdb", "node-red-contrib-telegrambot", and "node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker". Once you find each node, click the "Install" button next to them to install them. These nodes will enable the integration of InfluxDB, Telegram, and MQTT in Node-RED.

Step 5: Press Ctrl + I to import the flows.json file from the provided Github Repository under the "./NodeRED/" directory. This file contains the pre-configured flows for your project.

Note: Before proceeding with the import, make sure you have configured the necessary information for Telegram, InfluxDB, and MQTT, as mentioned in the tutorial. Refer to the tutorial for setting up the connections.

Step 6: Once the import is complete, the flows from the flows.json file will be visible in the Node-RED interface. You can examine and modify them as needed to suit your project requirements.

Step 7: Configure the connections in Node-RED by entering the relevant information you noted down earlier for Telegram, InfluxDB, and MQTT. This will ensure proper communication and data exchange between the services.

Step 8: Refer to the tutorial mentioned earlier on how to configure the MQTT connection. Follow the instructions provided in that tutorial to set up the MQTT connection in Node-RED.

Step 9: Similarly, configure the Telegram and InfluxDB connections in Node-RED by entering the required information in their respective fields. Consult the tutorial for configuring Telegram and InfluxDB connections for detailed instructions.

Step 10: Once you have configured the connections, you are ready to use Node-RED for your IoT project with InfluxDB, Telegram, and MQTT integration.
