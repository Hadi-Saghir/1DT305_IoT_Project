    - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Iminyourarea

    - IoT_1DT305
  volumes:
    - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana

Step 3: To reconfigure Grafana, modify the environment variables as needed

Step 4: recompose docker

Step 5: Save the changes to the Docker Compose file.

Step 6: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Docker Compose file is located.
