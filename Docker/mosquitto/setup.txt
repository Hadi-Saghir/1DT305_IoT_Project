I configured SSL certificate using OpenSSL. Please read more on their website and visit the binaries (https://www.openssl.org/) to download the appropiate version

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
openssl req -sha256 -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=ENTER IP ADDRESS"
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Under 1DT305_IoT_Project\Docker\mosquitto\cert, you can find the file make-keys-docker-compose.sl that your can run using Gitbash for similar software,
but make sure to edit the variables according to your application.

Move the necessary files in mosquitto/cert/*

import the files on the pico and to NodeRED volume to be able to connect to Mosquitto.

copy this code in secrets.py
  import ssl
  
  ca_cert_path = '/certs/ca.key'
  user_cert_path = '/certs/client.key'
  user_key_path = '/certs/server.key'
  
  with open(ca_cert_path, 'rb') as f:
      ca_data = f.read()
  print('Read CA Certificate... OK')
  
  with open(user_cert_path, 'rb') as f:
      user_cert = f.read()
  print('Read User Certificate... OK')
  
  with open(user_key_path, 'rb') as f:
      user_key = f.read()
  print('Read User Key... OK')

  #inside the secrets = {
    ...
    SSL_PARAMS = {
      'certfile': user_cert_path,
      'keyfile': user_key_path,
      'cadata': ca_data,
      'server_hostname': self.broker,
      'server_side': False,
      'cert_reqs': ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
      'do_handshake': True
    }
  }
