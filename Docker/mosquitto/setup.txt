I configured SSL certificate using OpenSSL. Please read more on their website and visit the binaries (https://www.openssl.org/) to download the appropiate version

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048
openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key
openssl req -sha256 -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=ENTER IP ADDRESS"
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Under 1DT305_IoT_Project\Docker\mosquitto\cert, you can find the file make-keys-docker-compose.sl that your can run using Gitbash for similar software,
but make sure to edit the variables according to your application.

Move the necessary files to their respective location.

#Delete this line when adding SSL
allow_anonymous true
listener 1883

#Comment in this on when adding SSL
#listener 8883
#certfile /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.crt
#keyfile /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.key

persistence true
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/

plugin /usr/lib/mosquitto_dynamic_security.so
plugin_opt_config_file /mosquitto/data/dynamic-security.json

make sure to change the port in docker-compose.yml as well:

  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:2-openssl
    ports:
      - 1883:1883 # close this port, if unnecessary
      - 8883:8883 #SSL port, but don't open it for no reason
    networks:
      - IoT_1DT305
    volumes:
      - ./mosquitto/config:/mosquitto/config
      - ./mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data
