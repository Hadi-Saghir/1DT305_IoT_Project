This option is if you want to host telegram using python and not Node-RED

#Setup the Telegrambot
Download the Telegram mobile app or visit https://telegram.org/ on your computer.
Sign up for a Telegram account if you don’t have one already.
In the Telegram app or web interface, search for the “BotFather” and start a chat with it.
Follow the instructions provided by the BotFather to create a new Telegram bot and obtain the API token for the bot.
Make a note of the API token as you will need it to connect your Node-RED flow with Telegram:
	Tele_API = "Enter key here"

# Install requirements
pip install python-telegram-bot
pip install requests

# create .env file and store the following
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = "YOUR TELEGRAM TOKEN"
